//Write a program which advices the user where to go to a vacation based on the type of the vacation and the budget. There
//should be two options â€“ Beach, Mountain. If the user put a different value then the program should print a message that there is
//no information about this type of vacation. Budgets are considered per day per person. If the budget per day for Beach type
//vacation is smaller than 50 then the program should advise Bulgaria as a destination, otherwise Outside Bulgaria. If the budget
//per day for Mountain type vacation is smaller than 30 then the program should advise Bulgaria as a destination, otherwise
//Outside Bulgaria.
